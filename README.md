# 1 - Analyze The New York Stock Exchange Data
In this project, I used statistics and spreadsheet software such as Excel to analyze data from more than 500 companies on the New York Stock Exchange. I will also predict financial metrics based on three possible scenarios for three companies in for IT Consulting & Other Services sector from the NYSE data set.


# 2 - Query a Digital Music Store Database
In this project, I will query a digital music store database which holds information regarding the storeâ€™s media, employees, and customers. I will use the database to help the store gain an understanding of the types of music that are purchased, where customers live, and how the company might optimize their business practices.


# 3 - Visualizations in Tableau
In this project, I will create interactive dashboards using Tableau and use them to discover and disseminate insights from data. I'll use a dataset on US flight delays to visualize the quality of airlines and airports, find the best times to fly, explore flight cancellations by airlines for each month, and reasons for cancellations, and more.


# 4 - Regional Sales Analysis using PowerBI
This project involves analyzing various aspects of a regional sales dataset using PowerBI. The project includes steps such as importing, processing and cleaning the data set to make it ready for visualization, creating appropriate relationships between the different tables in the data set, also creating and calculating some metrics such as fiscal years & months, revenues & revenues previous months, Import quota and Month-over-Month Growth Metrics (MoM%), and finally visualization of information to extract meaningful insights from them.
